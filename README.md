# Python_Itertools_module_function_implementation

Pythonâ€™s Itertool is a module that provides various functions that work on iterators to produce complex iterators.
This module works as a fast, memory-efficient tool that is used either by themselves or in combination to form iterator algebra.

Basically they are divided in two 3 parts:
1. Infitnite iterators
2. combinatoric iterators
3. terminating iterators

The file contains examples,exmplaination as well as implementation of all the functions that comes under python's itertools module.
